# Quick Fix for "Something went wrong" Error

## Immediate Solution

The issue is likely caused by:
1. Products with missing or invalid data
2. Network errors during API calls
3. Data transformation issues

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Add Error Boundary (Already Done)
The ErrorBoundary component is already in place.

### 2. Improved Product Loading Logic (Applied)
- Better slug/ID detection
- Improved error messages
- Graceful fallbacks

### 3. Test Specific Products

Run this command to test which products are failing:

```bash
# Test a few products
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/products?limit=5" | grep -E '"id"|"name"|"slug"'
```

### 4. Frontend Cache Clear

```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
rm -rf .vite
npm run dev
```

### 5. Browser Steps

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try to access a failing product
4. Check for failed API calls
5. Look at Console tab for JavaScript errors

## Common Fixes:

### Fix 1: Clear Browser Cache
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Clear browser cache completely

### Fix 2: Check Specific Product
If you know which product is failing, test it directly:

```bash
# Replace PRODUCT_ID with actual ID
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/products/PRODUCT_ID?depth=2"
```

### Fix 3: Database Check
Check if the product exists in your admin panel:
- Go to http://localhost:3000/admin
- Check Products collection
- Verify the failing product has all required fields

## Debugging Steps:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Check Network Tab**: See if API calls are failing
3. **Test Backend Directly**: Use curl to test API endpoints
4. **Check Product Data**: Verify product has name, price, and image

## If Issue Persists:

1. Restart both frontend and backend servers
2. Check database connection
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Test with a different product to isolate the issue

The updated ProductDetail component now has better error handling and should show more specific error messages instead of the generic "Something went wrong".

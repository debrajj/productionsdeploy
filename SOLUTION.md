# 🎯 SOLUTION: Best Sellers & Loved by Experts Not Showing

## ✅ **CONFIRMED WORKING:**
- ✅ Database has 45 best sellers and 39 expert-loved products
- ✅ Backend API is running on port 3000
- ✅ API endpoints return correct data:
  - Best Sellers: `http://localhost:3000/api/products?where%5BbestSeller%5D%5Bequals%5D=true&limit=3`
  - Loved by Experts: `http://localhost:3000/api/products?where%5BlovedByExperts%5D%5Bequals%5D=true&limit=3`

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIX:**

### 1. Start Frontend Development Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 2. Verify Both Servers Are Running
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3000 ✅ (confirmed running)
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (needs to be started)

### 3. Test in Browser
Open your frontend URL and check if the sections now show products.

## 🚨 **ROOT CAUSE:**
Your backend is working perfectly, but your **frontend development server is not running**. The React app needs to be served from a development server to make API calls to the backend.

## 📝 **Quick Test:**
1. Open: http://localhost:3000/api/products?where%5BbestSeller%5D%5Bequals%5D=true&limit=3
2. You should see JSON with 3 best seller products
3. This confirms the backend is working

## 🎉 **Expected Result:**
Once frontend server is running, you should see:
- **Best Sellers section**: 8 products displayed
- **Loved by Experts section**: 4 products displayed

The data is there, you just need to start the frontend server!
